	  <article class="three_quarter" align="left" style="text-align: justify;" >Due to physical limitations, people are not able to learn recent advances and discuss research ideas face to face all the time. Thus, this webinar aims to bring the light from inspired scholars in our community, and therefore we are thrilled to announce Design Automation WebiNar (DAWN) to drive research momentum. DAWN is designed as an online event open to students, scholars, researchers and professionals in both academia and industry of the EDA community. Different from the conventional keynote- and sole-speaker-style webinars, DAWN is a special-session-style webinar and is formed by multiple presentations on a focused topic or theme by leading experts in our community.</article>
